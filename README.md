### Hello there, I've created a tool to populate the Realtime Database by Firebase.

## Because i got tired of entering the data manually, I've developed this program in half a day. 😏 
## It is written in Python so you will need the libraries:
- wxPython
- pandas
- requests
- firebase_admin

# The program is lite and works really well, it is not restricting at all.
- This is a feature 😅

It has a simple GUI, and you can choose how many elements the JSON has dinamically

After you complete the reference and the number of elements that you need press the button.
The GUI will extend.

When u press upload, the information will be written to the Realtime Database.
