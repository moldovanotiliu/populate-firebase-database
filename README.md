### Hello there, I've created a tool to populate the Realtime Database by Firebase.

## Because i got tired of entering the data manually, I've developed in half a day this program. 😏 
## It is written in Python so u will need the libraries:
- wxPython
- pandas
- requests
- firebase_admin

# The program is lite and works really well, it is not restricting at all.
- This is a feature 😅

It has a simple GUI, and u can choose how many elements the JSON has dinamically
